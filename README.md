# advanced-digital-multiplier
Our goal in this  project to design a fast Binary multiplier  ,
 using different concepts and approaches for  designing the parts that will be used in implementation ,
 the multiplier will be constructed structurally in VHDL ,
 and it will  consist  like any logic circuit from  basic logic gates (inverter , AND , OR , NAND , NOR , XOR and XNOR ) ,
 and those gate will be used to implement two types of Adders: Ripple Carry Adder and Carry look ahead Adder .

in  The Second Part of the Project will handle the Verification for the design using exhaustive testing technique,
  which include testing all possible values for input and monitor the output of the multiplier ,
  and to do that we  built a Test Generator that will generate all Possible Test Vector  Continuously ,
  on the other hand  due to the  large number of Test Vectors  we  designed An analyzer Circuit 
  which will decide if the output of the Multiplier is Correct or not by comparing 
  Result with Actual Result that  we got using original  Multiplication ( * )  operation .
